# gaslaw
The Ideal Gas Law - Boyle's law from 1662, states that at constant temperature for a fixed mass, the absolute pressure and the volume of a gas are inversely proportional. This animation illustrates the normal air we breath at 20Â°C. Free flowing molecules are travelling an average 2.1 nanometers per picosecond, trapped in a 3D box, 30 x 10 x 7.5 nanometers in size.

The Ideal Gas Law

PV = nRT

P is pressure,
V is volume,
n is number of molecules,
R is the gas constant, and
T is absolute temperatures
